# ShooterGameBugFix
Bug fixing from the first exercise

Due to the project large size and to avoid the upload of the same unmodified files, only the Blueprint folder has been pushed, the complete project can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ES-xUBSY8oRoJAjSb5sgKsxgOK6Qkfm?usp=sharing)
